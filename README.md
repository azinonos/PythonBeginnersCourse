Exercises &amp; Answers for my Python Beginners Course at: 

## Contents
I will be uploading material such as exercises for you to solve here after every week's lesson. It is very important to get hands on when learning programming instead of only watching the tutorials, and the best way to do it is to solve problems. This will get you in the habit of thinking programmaticaly in order to be able to apply your knowledge to real world problems later on. Answers will also be provided in case you get stuck or if you want to compare your solutions to mine. If you have any question at all, make sure to leave it at the comments section of the corresponding YouTube video I will have linked at the beginning of the code. Happy Coding :)
